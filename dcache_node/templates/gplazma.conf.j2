# Login Phases:
#   [auth]
#       - auth-plugins are used to read the users public and private
#         credentials and ask some authority, if those are valid for accessing 
#         the system. 
#   [map]
#       - map-plugins map the user information obtained in the auth step to UID
#         and GIDs. 
#       - This may also be done in several steps (e.g., the vorolemap plugin 
#         maps the users DN+FQAN to a username which is then mapped to UID/GIDs
#         by the authzdb plugin)
#   [account]
#       - account-plugins verify the validity of a possibly mapped of the user 
#         and may reject the login depending on information gathered within the 
#         map step.
#   [session]
#       - session plugins usually enrich the session with additional attributes
#         like the userâ€™s home directory.
#   [identity]
#       - identity plugins are responsible for mapping UID and GID to user
#         names and vice versa during the work with dCache.

# Modifiers:
#   [optional]
#       - The success or failure of this plugin is only important if it is the 
#         only plugin in the stack associated with this type. 
#   [sufficient]
#       - Success of such a plugin is enough to satisfy the authentication 
#         requirements of the stack of plugins (if a prior required plugin has
#         failed the success of this one is ignored). 
#       - A failure of this plugin isn't deemed as fatal for the login attempt.
#       - If the plugin succeeds gPlazma2 immediately proceeds with the next 
#         plugin type or returns control to the door if this was the last stack. 
#   [required]
#       - Failure of such a plugin will ultimately lead to gPlazma2 returning 
#         failure but only after the remaining plugins for this type have been 
#         invoked. 
#   [requisite]
#       - Like required, however, in the case that such a plugin returns a
#         failure, control is directly returned
