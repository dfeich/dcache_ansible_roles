* ansible roles for installing a dCache storage service

  These dcache roles allow the complete installation of a [[https://www.dcache.org/][dCache]]
  service with all of its cells. They allow flexibly distributing
  cells over different hosts.

  I also add some example playbooks using these roles, and an example
  inventory. Actually, I think without an example inventory it would
  not be very clear how to organize the services.

  I've been using this code for managing my production and test site
  for multiple years. I hope it will be useful to others.
  
** install a full dCache test or production system

   #+begin_src bash
     ansible-playbook -D -i inventory dcache_install.yml

     # Only do DB installation tasks
     ansible-playbook -D -i inventory_t3test dcache_install.yml --tags db
   #+END_SRC

   Only do the DB installation tasks
   #+begin_src bash
     ansible-playbook -D -i inventory_t3test dcache_install.yml --tags db
   #+END_SRC
   
   Just update configuration files (tag: conf) and only on the
   test-dcachedb01.psi.ch test host
   #+begin_src bash
     ansible-playbook -D -i inventory_t3test dcache_install.yml --tags conf --limit test-dcachedb01.psi.ch
   #+end_src
